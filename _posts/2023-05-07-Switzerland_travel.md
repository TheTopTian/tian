Finally we made our plan to travel to Switzerland, my first time to there. Here are two photos from the top of the First mountain. My face accidentally got some sunburn :disappointed_relieved:

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/Switzerland_trip/1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true%}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/Switzerland_trip/2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true%}
    </div>

Everything is super expensive in Bern, the capital of Switzerland. But I really like this city, whole urban is surrounded by the mountain and forest.
