I"<p>Hello, Tian here! I am a machine learning researcher focusing on the medical image.</p>

<p>Using machine learning in medical images is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to revolutionize the way medical professionals diagnose and treat diseases. Machine learning algorithms can help medical professionals to analyze large amounts of medical image data quickly and accurately, allowing them to identify potential health issues earlier and with greater precision.</p>

<p>I am currently studying my master program in <strong>RWTH Aachen University</strong>, majoring in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Robotic Systems</code>. In the recent months, I am writing my master thesis in <strong>Uniklinik RWTH Aachen</strong>, the department <a href="https://www.ukaachen.de/kliniken-institute/klinik-fuer-diagnostische-und-interventionelle-radiologie/forschung/mm-machine-learning-and-musculoskeletal-imaging/"><strong>M&amp;M</strong></a>, the topic is about: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Transformers for the Classification of Knee Diseases in MRI</code>.</p>

<p>After graduate from RWTH, I am willing to keep working as an AI researcher in medical field. If you are interested in me, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact with me! :smiley:</p>
